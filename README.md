# Content-Based-Movie-Recommendation-System
In this project for recommendation of movies we have used content based filtering technique. In this we take only five essential features i.e. title, actors, genre, writers, directors from the dataset rest are ignored. Using those five essential features we calculate similarity between movies using TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity. So, All related movies which is having more cosine similarity score with the given movies are printed in descending order. We can enhance our recommendation system by using collaborative filtering or hybrid model.

New Recommender.py file is having coding part and dataset which is used in this program is BollywoodMovieDetail.csv.
